Data collection
    - Trawl twitter


    Reference for how the API retrieves results:
    https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets

    looks like the API is restricted (low query count, max 100 queries per search, etc.)
    30-day search is accessible with a configurable endpoint
    https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview/premium

    collection procedure:
    before the pres: quick trawl of tweets over the last week via the basic API
    after:
        - explore capabilities of Sandbox 30-day plan [Ersin] < After presentation?
        - maybe all our dev accounts can trawl 25K tweets for a 125K tweet dataset.


    - list news sources used (BBC etc.)
    - cite any reports we use
    - CSSE database
